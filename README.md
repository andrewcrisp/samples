# Programming samples

## Purpose

To collect various programming exercises that I attempt. I'm mostly inspired by the coding challenges on the Coding Train Youtube channel. Expect to find small exercises similar to what is shown there. My intent is to try implementing solutions to the problems demonstrated and only referring back to the inspiration when necessary.  

## Instructions

The langauge used for each sample may vary. Each sample should be self contained in a folder. Begin by cloning the repo, moving to the folder of interest, and following the language specific instructions below:

### Pyhon

I'm using conda environments to keep things coordinated. Install an anaconda environment of your choice (I use miniconda[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html]), recreate the conda environment from the environment.yml file, and start in the app.py file. app.py should always be the demonstration kickoff script.
